### Theory:

Before piloting your drone outside for the first time, you must calibrate the drone’s compass. Calibration is also needed if your drone has been flying inconsistently or not flying like it usually does. Many experts believe that a drone needs calibrating each time that it operates, especially if it will be flying in a new location.

### WHEN TO CALIBRATE YOUR DRONE

Knowing when to calibrate your drone will make a massive difference in performance. Here are a few tips that can help you determine if your drone needs calibrating.<br>

1. It is the drone’s first flight.
2. It has been more than a month since you have flown your drone.
3. The compass displays interference warnings after changing the location
4. Your flying location is more than six miles from the last flight location
5. There are irregularities, the drone is not flying straight, or after any crash

#### THINGS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO CALIBRATE YOUR DRONE

Calibrating your drone is quite simple. However, there are certain things you will need for a successful calibration.

1. A wide-open area for a good line of sight
2. A fully charged battery.
3. Batteries for your remote control.
4. A cold climate is preferred to prevent overheating.
5. A device such as your tablet or phone for programming.
6. The drone should never be hot when calibrating. The aircraft needs to be shut off for at least ten minutes after it has been running.
7. Make sure you have a level surface.
8. Prep the drone by removing the propellers, removing the gimble guard, and turning on naza-m v2 and the remote, depending on the brand.

#### There are two types of calibration, IMU calibration, and Compass Calibration.

### IMU CALIBRATION

The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a crucial component in drones, responsible for measuring acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation. It consists of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers to track movement and stability. The IMU helps the flight controller maintain balance, stabilize the drone, and enable precise movements by continuously sending real-time motion data. During calibration, the IMU ensures accurate sensor readings by eliminating any drift or inconsistencies. A pictorial representation of an IMU typically includes a small circuit board with embedded sensors, often integrated into the drone’s flight controller module.

#### Example of IMU Calibration:

IMU calibration is necessary to ensure accurate motion sensing. For example, when setting up a DJI drone, users are required to place the drone on a flat surface and follow on-screen instructions, which include positioning the drone in different orientations (such as laying it on its side and upside down). This process helps correct drift and ensures stable flight.

### COMPASS CALIBRATION

Compass calibration is needed to find true north. It is necessary to calibrate if the drone will be flying in a new location (more than 6 miles away) or if there are error messages.

Make sure you are away from any metal structures or concrete parking lot, which can interfere with calibration. Also, stay clear of cellphone towers.

Basics for Most Drones
<br>
Compass calibration for drones is pretty much the same for most devices.

#### Example of Compass Calibration:

Compass calibration is essential to avoid interference from surrounding electromagnetic fields. For instance, when calibrating a Parrot Anafi drone, the user is instructed to rotate the drone horizontally and then vertically in a full circle while holding it away from metal objects. This ensures the drone aligns correctly with the Earth's magnetic field for precise navigation.
