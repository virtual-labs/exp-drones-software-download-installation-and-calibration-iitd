### Theory:

Before piloting your drone outside for the first time, you must calibrate the drone’s compass. Calibration is also needed if your drone has been flying inconsistently or not flying like it usually does. Many experts believe that a drone needs calibrating each time that it operates, especially if it will be flying in a new location.

### WHEN TO CALIBRATE YOUR DRONE

Knowing when to calibrate your drone will make a massive difference in performance. Here are a few tips that can help you determine if your drone needs calibrating.<br>

1. It is the drone’s first flight.
2. It has been more than a month since you have flown your drone.
3. The compass displays interference warnings after changing the location
4. Your flying location is more than six miles from the last flight location
5. There are irregularities, the drone is not flying straight, or after any crash

#### THINGS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO CALIBRATE YOUR DRONE

Calibrating your drone is quite simple. However, there are certain things you will need for a successful calibration.

1. A wide-open area for a good line of sight
2. A fully charged battery.
3. Batteries for your remote control.
4. A cold climate is preferred to prevent overheating.
5. A device such as your tablet or phone for programming.
6. The drone should never be hot when calibrating. The aircraft needs to be shut off for at least ten minutes after it has been running.
7. Make sure you have a level surface.
8. Prep the drone by removing the propellers, removing the gimble guard, and turning on nomadic two and the remote, depending on the brand.

#### There are two types of calibration, IMU calibration, and Compass Calibration.

### IMU CALIBRATION

An IMU is a circuit that keeps the drone level and flat. IMU control the pitch and roll. Calibrating the IMU is can be done indoors on a flat surface like a table.

Before you click the Start button, the drone should be as flat as possible, powered up, that you remove the gimble guard, and the legs stretched out. Also, the position for the drone should be facing to the left.

### COMPASS CALIBRATION

Compass calibration is needed to find true north. It is necessary to calibrate if the drone will be flying in a new location (more than 6 miles away) or if there are error messages.

Make sure you are away from any metal structures or concrete parking lot, which can interfere with calibration. Also, stay clear of cellphone towers.
